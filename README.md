Online data and code appendix 

All the code is in Python 2.7. To run a python file, just download the appropriate 
python distribution for your computer from http://www.python.org 

## Description of the files: 

  - File "data_www.csv" contains the raw data used for plots I and II of the paper. 
 
  - File "data_work.py" contains the Python code to generate plots I
    and II. File "data_work_mathematica.m" generates the same plots in Mathematica.

  - File "speed_convergence.py" contains the code to generate the speeds of
    convergence for the linearized model. 

  - File "simulation_figures.py" contains the main code that runs the simulations of
    the model. 

## Usage

In a Linux distribution, from the command line, issue the following commands:

$ python data_work.py

$ python simulation_figures.py

$ python speed_convergence.py

And figures will be generated in the current directory. 

Be sure that you have python, as well as the numpy and scipy packages installed in 
your machine.
